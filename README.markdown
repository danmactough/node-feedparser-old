#  Feedparser - Robust RSS, Atom, and RDF feed parsing in Node.js 
      
This module adds methods for RSS, Atom, and RDF feed parsing in node.js using libxmljs.

## Requirements

Feedparser uses libxmljs to parse XML. libxmljs requires `scons` to be installed prior to installing through [npm](http://npmjs.org).

### Installing `scons` through Homebrew

On Mac OS X, the easiest way to install `scons` is using [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/), a great package manager for OS X. With `brew` installed, simply open Terminal and type:

    brew install scons


### Installing `scons` through APT/yum

On Debian based Linux distributions like Ubuntu, simply install using `apt-get` like this:

    sudo apt-get install scons

On RedHat based Linux distributions like Fedora or CentOS, simply install using `yum` like this:

    sudo yum install scons

## Installation

    npm install feedparser

## Example

```javascript
var FeedParser = require('feedparser')
  , fs = require('fs')
  , parser

parser = new FeedParser();

parser.on('article', function(article){
    console.log('Got article: %s', JSON.stringify(article));
});

parser.parseFile('./feed');
```
